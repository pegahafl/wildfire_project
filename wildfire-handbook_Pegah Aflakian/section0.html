      <h2>ðŸ”¥ What Are Wildfires?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>wildfire</strong> is an unplanned and uncontrolled fire that burns in natural vegetation like shrubs or forests.
 <p> 
As building development expands into these areas, homes and business may be situated in or near areas susceptible to wildfires.This is called the <strong>wildland urban interface</strong>(suburbs). Wildfires can damage natural resources, destroy homes, and threaten the safety of the public and the
firefighters who protect forests and communities

            </p>
  wildfire happens when three things come together:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fuel</strong> â€“ plants and vegetation that can burn</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental conditions</strong> â€“ dry weather, heat, or wind</li>
        <li><strong>Ignition source</strong> â€“ lightning or human activity</li>
      </ul>
